 * macros), which tweak the behaviour of include files. Our intent is to
 * define here in a unique place the required macros exposing the functions
 * we like to have.
 *
 * IT IS NECESSARY THAT THIS FILE APPEARS ONLY ON TOP OF THE COMPILATION
 * UNITS, AND BEFORE ANY OTHER HEADER. We promise to never include
 * another header file as a side-effect of this one (except
 * cado_config.h, which makes sense to include here as well).
 *
 * To make sure that the repository abides by the law above, see
 * scripts/check_compilation_units_policy.pl
