/* 202207. The cado-nfs matrix format changes.
 *
 * A matrix is actually a collection of files, all sharing the same base
 * name (say $X below).
 * - $X.rows contains the column positions of the non-zero coefficients
 *   in each row, thus in row major order. Each coefficient position is
 *   stored as a 32-bit unsigned little-endian integer. Therefore if the
 *   matrix has a total of N non-zero coefficients, $X.rows cwishas exactly
 *   N*4 bytes long.
 * - $X.cols is the same with row indices in column major order
 * - $X.row_offsets is a list of 32-bit unsigned little endian integers.
 *   The $i$-th of these integers is the number of non-zero coefficients
 *   in rows $0$ to $i$, inclusive. The number of integers in the
 *   row_offsets file is exactly the number of rows of the matrix.
 * - $X.col_offsets is the same for columns.
 *
 * - $X.row_coeffs exists if and only if the matrix is defined over a
 *   field different from GF(2). It has exactly the same size as $X.rows,
 *   and contains 32-bit *signed* little-endian integers. The k-th
 *   integer in the file $X.rows encodes that some non-zero coefficient
 *   is at a given (r,c) position within the matrix, and the value of
 *   this coefficient is of course the k-th integer in $X.row_coeffs
 *
 * - $X.col_coeffs is the same for columns.
 *
 * It is never sufficient to have only one of these files, and it is
 * hardly ever useful to have all of them (and anyway not all of them get
 * created by default).
 *
 * The following combinations are valid. Note that the row_offsets and
 * col_offsets must always be present.
 *
 * - $X.rows + $X.row_offsets + $X.col_offsets :
 *   This is the most common data set for binary matrices.
 *
 * - $X.rows + $X.row_offsets + $X.col_offsets + $X.row_coeffs
 *   This extends the above scheme for matrices over GF(p).
 *
 * - $X.cols + $X.row_offsets + $X.col_offsets :
 *   This is an alternative representation. It makes sense to have this
 *   if the matrix is to be read in transposed form.
 *
 * - $X.cols + $X.row_offsets + $X.col_offsets + $X.col_coeffs
 *   This is an alternative representation.
 *
 * Also, we may have:
 *
 * - $X.rows + $X.row_offsets + $X.col_offsets + $X.cols :
 *   This allows speedy reading of the matrix data, either transposed or
 *   not.
 *   (likewise with coefficients added)
 *
 * Conceptually, $X.rows + $X.row_offsets (or the same with columns) is
 * enough to reconstruct a complete matrix file set. Of course, if the
 * matrix is not over GF(2), the coefficients files must be present as
 * well.
 *
 * The tools to convert to/from other matrix formats and to complete an
 * existing matrix file set into another one are not written yet.
