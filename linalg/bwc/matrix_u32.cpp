     * split over a processor grid of size 100x100, and with the

     * save_submatrices=1) save submatrices of size 100k * 99k, but in
     * column major order. In turn,
     * if we use the bench program on such submatrices, we will (as per
     * matrix_read_pass above) read them in row major order to count a
     * ``number of rows'' (in fact, columns), and a ``number of columns''
     * (in fact, rows).
     *
     * XXX These fields used to be set from mf_prepare_matrix_u32, in the
     * matmul_ptr field. Now this step no longer takes place here, so
     * this all needs a new home.
