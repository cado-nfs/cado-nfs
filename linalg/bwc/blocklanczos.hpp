     * V[n0] is the V vector which is the input to iteration n. It does
     *       not consist of independent  vectors.
     * D[n0] is the extracted set of columns, computed from V[n0] (and
     *       also from D[n1]. Together, V[n0] and D[n0] allow to compute
     *       the basis of the n-th sub vector space W, although no
     *       explicit data is reserved to its storage.
     * L[n0] is computed from V[n0] and D[n0], and is some sort of local
     *       inverse (iirc, it's W_i^{inv} in most accounts).
     *
     * of course *[n1] and *[n2] are the same for the previous steps.
     *
     * In order to compute the vector for step n + 1, the data to be used
     * is V[*], L[*], and D[n0, n1]
