# This script is responsible of handing over the build process, in a
# proper out of source build directory. It takes care of calling cmake
# first if needed, and then cd's into the proper sub-directory of the
# build tree, and runs make there. The intent is that this script is
# called from a Makefile within the source tree.
# In particular, the following tasks are done,
#  - check if the calling path is correct?
#  - if exists, parse the file ${up_path}/local.sh
#  - check if cmake is installed
#  - "cmake" to generate Makefile
#  - "make"
#
# Type "make ?" for more options.
