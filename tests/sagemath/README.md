sagemath helpers for cado-nfs
=

This set of scripts is meant to allow debugging of cado-nfs from within
sagemath, and/or to develop sagemath stuff based on sagemath
functionalities.

It's very much work in progress, and the direction where we're heading is
not totally clear, to be honest. For the time being, most of this stuff
is routinely used to check what cado-nfs is doing with some continuous
integration tests that are run with sagemath.
