"""
This package is work in progress. As of late 2023, it is still far from
the functionality level of the original magma script

The work plan is:
    1. prime field case (nullspace=right), with arbitrary balancing
        âœ… This works for a few automated tests, at least as far lingen
    2. we want to use this to debug the double matrix setting
    3. extend to the binary case (nullspace=left). We know that there are
       a few monsters down that path, like m4ri data being hard to
       initialize totally freely from within sage
    4. address the remaining cases like interleaving and so on.
