# took inspiration from https://blog.callr.tech/building-docker-images-with-gitlab-ci-best-practices/
# however I'm not sure if/how the "latest" tagging actually works.

# Note that the name of each section is significant, as the file
# ci/ci/001-environment.sh sets some important environment variables based
# on what it finds. E.g. it reacts to "with gcc", "expensive checks",
# "coverage tests", and so on.

# We're using a few features from gitlab yaml:
#
# - [yaml anchors](https://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/yaml/#anchors)
# - manual disable of pipeline elements, which we do more or less by hand
#   (finer grained than the ["skip ci"
#   syntax](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#skip-pipeline))
