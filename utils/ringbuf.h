/* Getting data from a rolling buffer can be done via two interfaces. One
 * interface (ringbuf_get) provides a pointer, while the other
 * (ringbuf_get2) does not, and asks the ringbuf interface to provide a
 * pointer.
 *
 * The area pointed to by the pointer returned from ringbuf_get2 is free
 * to be read from by the calling thread until the next call to
 * ringbuf_get. This implies in particular that we assume that there is
 * exactly one threading getting data, no more.
 *
 * Note though that this is not implemented by means of a zero-copy
 * mechanism (doing so would make rollback_put break the active area of
 * data being read, in case a realloc() occurs). The data is copied to a
 * buffer exclusively dedicated to reading.
 *
 * (the reading buffer is allocated only if needed, and freed by
 * ringbuf_clear eventually)
