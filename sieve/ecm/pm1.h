/* Notes:
  If s_1 * s_2 = eulerphi(d), we need s_1 precomputed values, s_2 passes and
  ~(B2-B1)/d steps in each pass. Assuming we can compute V_{k_1}(x+1/x)
  and V_{k_2}(x+1/x) with about 1 multiply per value by using a common
  addition chain for S_1 \cup S_2, we can reduce the precomputation cost to
  only s_1 + s_2 instead of eulerphi(P) if we do only 1 pass. This allows for
  a larger d: with only 1 pass, sqrt(B2-B1) is optimal, with a flexible number
  of passes, (B2-B1)^{2/3} is optimal.
  
  In one pass we process one k_2 \in S_2 and thus primes p = i*d +- j with
  j = k_1 + k_2, k_1 \in S_1. We'd like to be able to bound these j by d/2 
  so that we get compact "block" with no overlap between consecutive blocks.
  This prevents having to start at lower i/continue to larger i than 
  necessary, to be able to write all p, B_1 < p <= B_2, as 
  p = i*d +- (k_1 + k_2). However, there seems to be no way to write the 
  smallest positive representatives <d/2 of units mod d as a sum of two sets:
  e.g. for d=30, we'd like {1,7,11,13}.
