/* A "task collection" designates the set of special-q's that a single
 * las process handles over its lifetime.
 *
 * If we're doing a special-q descent, we use the complicated
 * special_q_task_collection_tree object. Otherwise (normal case) we use
 * the much simpler special_q_task_collection_simple.
 *
 * In most cases, special q tasks are created as unique_ptr's, and used
 * via the base interface special_q_task * (which can point to an
 * instance of either special_q_task_simple or special_q_task_tree).
 *
 * Within the special_q_task_collection, a special q can exist in several
 * different states, which are encoded by special_q_task::status_code.
 *
 *  - PENDING: this task has been created, but no las thread currently
 *    works on this special-q. Either it was very recently allocated, or
 *    it is sitting in a storage area, waiting to be picked up (pulled)
 *    by a thread willing to do work.
 *  - IN_PROGRESS: this task was pulled by a thread, which is currently
 *    actively collecting relation for this special-q
 *  - IN_RECURSION (for the descent only): relation collection for this
 *    task is done, but some children tasks were created out of it. These
 *    tasks are not done yet, so the final state of this task depends on
 *    them.
 *  - ABANDONED (for the descent only): we could not find any useful
 *    relation for this task, or all the relations that we found have
 *    failed.  Some extra attempts are allowed, but once this is over,
 *    the task is marked as failed (and the parent task has to try
 *    another relation). 
 *  - DONE: everything is good.
 *
 * The state machine is as follows. Most of what is here only applies to
 * the recursive descent case. The "normal", non-descent case is simple
 * enough and does not need much further detail.
 *
 * Creation of a task is done either from the las_todo_list object, or
 * antonomously from the recursion (in the descent case). When a task is
 * created, the counter `created` is increased by one.
 *
 * Pulling a task (via the `pull()` method) either picks a task from the
 * `all_pending` structure/
