/* A "simple" special-q task is what we use most of the time. It's
 * basically just a special-q, with a status field (perhaps we want to
 * add some statistics fields to it as well, starting with the time
 * spent, at least).
 *
 * This exists in order to provide a simple mirror of what we have for
 * the much more complex special_q_task_tree, which is used in the
 * descent. So most of the interfaces here look thin or even pointless,
 * but that is on purpose.
 *
 * As in the special_q_task_tree case, we have a state machine of
 * statuses, although it's much simpler because we have no recursion
 * involved.
