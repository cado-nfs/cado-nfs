/* We want to estimate number of products of primes:
 * l[0]-bit * l[1]-bit * ... * l[k-1]-bit
 * with product of exactly mfb bits, and each prime >= lim
 *
 * Two options exist.
 *
 *  - The first one is to generate primes (or numbers that follow the
 *    distribution of primes) in each of the bit ranges,
 *    determine how often this leads to a product with the exact
 *    requested bit size. This gives us a ratio. Apply the ratio to the
 *    complete population of choices of primes. This approach is
 *    probabilistic and requires a certain number of random picks in
 *    order to give something useful.
 *
 *  - The second approach is to work with the generating series of the
 *    product. This works best if replace bit sizes by ranges of number
 *    of digits in base gamma, for some gamma \in (1,2]. Smaller values
 *    of gamma (or equivalently larger values of log(beta)/log(gamma))
 *    lead to more accurate but more expensive calculations.
 *
 * In our experiments, it is reasonably easy to make these estimations
 * agree within 5%, with PREC = 100000 in the firt test, and gamma=1.005
 * in the second test.
