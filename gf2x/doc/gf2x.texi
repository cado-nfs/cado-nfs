@node Introduction to gf2x, Installing gf2x, Copying, Top

gf2x fulfills just one mission: multiplying polynomials over GF(2)[x],
both small and large ones.

Because coefficients of polynomials over GF(2) are simply bits, a packed
representation is necessary. In a way, multiplying polynomials over GF(2)
is like multiplying integers, except that you strip away all the carry
propagation. Yet no specialized software library provides access to fast
algorithms for doing this. gf2x fills this gap.

gf2x takes advantage of both low-level assembly instuctions when they
happen to be available, as well as advanced algorithms for the job.
@itemize @bullet
@item Assembly instruction for ``carry-less'' multiplication on 64-bit
Intel CPUs
@item Fine-tuned multiplication routines for small polynomials.
@item Karatsuba and Toom-Cook algorithms
@item Quasi-linear operations with FFT algorithms (both ternary FFT and
Cantor additive FFT).
@item Access to low-level parts of the FFT operations.
@end itemize

For up-to-date information on gf2x, and for the latest version of the
library, please see the Git repository page at

@cindex Mailing lists
There is a mailing list called @email{gf2x@@inria.fr}. Traffic is
extremely low. See @ref{Reporting bugs} for information about reporting
bugs.

Being mostly a one-man project, gf2x is never complete. There is
significant room for improvement in multiple aspects of the library. See
@ref{Helping out} if you're interested in participating in the
development.
