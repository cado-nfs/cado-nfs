/*
 * This is an implementation of a quick hash table with integer entries
 * that is meant to look for collisions among its integer entries. The
 * expected usage range is for integers up to about 50 bits, with at most
 * about 2^25 integers pushed to the hash table.
 *
 */

/* Entries are first pushed to buckets based on their low bits.
 *
 * Then buckets are examined one by one to look for collisions in them.
 *
 * For each integer i that went to a bucket, we know that i is in the
 * bucket that we're currently examining, so it has all its
 * LN2SHASH_NBUCKETS low bits in common with others in the same bucket.
 * We're going to do a secondary in-memory dispatch of this i into an
 * open hash table, with plentiful storage that should be sufficient to
 * keep long runs to a minimum.  The starting point in that open hash
 * table is given by the bits that follow the LN2SHASH_NBUCKETS low bits
 * (sufficiently many of these bits so that on average, we expect only
 * very few contiguous entries).
 *
 * The key that gets actually stored in the open hash table is used as a
 * tie-breaker for match that end up being inserted nearby. nearby values
 * share their low LN2SHASH_NBUCKETS bits as well as the high bits of
 * their insert location in the open hash table (not the low bits, since
 * overruns _may_ happen). This leaves a few different bits (typically
 * something like 32-(LN2SHASH_NBUCKETS=8)-(log2(open hash table
 * size)=approx 16) = less than 8 in the low part, plus something like
 * log2(2*4*P^2/2^32) = up to approx 20 bits in the high part.
 *
 * A "sure" tie breaker would arrange these bits so that there's no
 * overlap. But on the other hand (and because false positives are
 * actually _not_ a problem), we can go along with the simpler addition
 * of the low and high part of i, and hope for the best.
 *
 * Note that this algorithm does not correctly deal with the situation
 * where the integer 0 is added to the hash table. Fortunately, for our
 * application I think that this can't happen.
