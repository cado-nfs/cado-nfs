/* For the moment, this value is static. It's highly critical for
   performance. A priori, the right choice is guided by the number of TLB
   of the CPU being used. The values below are probably misleaded by
   other aspects ; quoting lingering comment:

   * 10 (or 9) seems the best for an Intel nehalem (?).
   * 6 seems the best for Intel Core2 (?).
   * 7 seems the best for AMD (?).
   So, the next optimization will include real time tests to
   evaluate the best value.
   NOTA: The good range is between 6 and 10. Don't use values <= 4!
   Values >= 12 are not interesting.
