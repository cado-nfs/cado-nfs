/* cbound_incr is the increment on the maximal cost of merges at each step.

/* Note about variables used in the code:
 * cwmax is the (current) maximal weight of columns that will be considered
   for a merge. It starts at cwmax=2. Once we have performed *all* 2-merges,
   we increase cwmax to 3, and at each step of the algorithm, we increase it
   by 1 (not waiting for all 3-merges to be completed).
 * cbound is the maximum (current) fill-in that is allowed for a merge
   (in fact, it is a biased value to avoid negative values, one should subtract
    BIAS from cbound to get the actual value). It starts at 0, and once all
    the 2-merges have been performed (which all give a negative fill-in, thus
    they will all be allowed), we increase cbound by CBOUND_INCR at each step
    of the algorithm (where CBOUND_INCR differs for integer factorization and
    discrete logarithm).
 * j0 means that we assume that columns of index < j0 cannot have
   weight <= cwmax. It depends on cwmax (decreases when cwmax increases).
   At the first call to compute_weights(), the values j0(cwmax=2) up to
   j0(MERGE_LEVEL_MAX) are computed once for all (since the weight of a
   column usually does not decrease, the values of j0 should remain correct
   during the algorithm, but not optimal).
   In several places we use the fact that the rows are sorted by increasing
   columns: if we start from the end, we can stop at soon as j < j0.
